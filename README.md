Personal Project: LoL teams.

This project intends to display information about League of Legend teams currently competing in the League of legends
world championship. These information includes, teams competing, team ranking, players, scores, and other statistics.
In the end i hope to include a section that updates live the scores of the games as it's going on, so users can check
the stats without watching the game.
This project is not final at the moment, and I may change these ideas later.
